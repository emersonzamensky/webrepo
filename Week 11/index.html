<h2>Her real name is Kathleen but that's ugly so she goes by Kate</h2>
<p>I met Kate when I was just 18 years young. She stumbled into my dorm room (Baker E135) on August 20th, 2018 with her shitty room decorations, horse girl haircut, and stale personality. Then, she drank alcohol, and just like that... she blossomed before my eyes. Ever since that night we've been inseperable. We laugh together, cry together, eat together, workout together, throw up together, and sleep together (in different beds but same room nonetheless). She is the peanut butter to my jelly, the mario to my luigi, and the soul to my sister. I don't know what I would do without Kathleen Elizabeth Coneys. </p>

<h2>About Kathleen</h2>
<p>Kathleen was born on October 25th, 1999 in Englewood, Colorado. She weighed 6 lbs 5 oz and had zero hair. She grew up in Parker her entire life (ew) and attended Ponderosa High School where she played volleyball and did whatever the hell DECA is. She also met her lover, Jayden, and they've been not together ever since. Currently, she is a senior at CU Boulder studying psych and iphy. Outside of schoolwork, she works for IM and is an honoary member of the Herd Leadership Council. Her hobbies include tiktok, eating 60 cent burritos, watching reality TV, pooping (she has IBS), lifting small weights, drinking burnetts, and following me around. Some would say she's a bit of genius. Others would say she's a loon. I would say that she's neither... she's my best friend. </p>
<p>When she grows up, Kate hopes to become a trophy wife. </p>
