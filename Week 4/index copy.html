			About me: <br>

			Hi! My name is Emerson and I am a senior studying Creative Technology and Design and minoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Outside of schoolwork at CU I am Co-President of the Herd Leadership Council, work for the Environmental Center, and play a lot of intramural sports. My goal for this course is to learn to code a cool looking website without procrastinating in doing so!
