					The content of <i>Regular Show</i> waslargely based off of creator J. G. Quintel's life and experiences in college. He attended the <a href="https://calarts.edu/">"California Institute of the Arts"</a>, and many of Regular Show's characters are based on the characters developed for films that he made as a student <i>The Na√Øve Man from Lolliland</i> (2005) and <i>2 in the AM PM</i> (2006). Both of which originated from a game called "48-hour films", where students pull one word out of a hat at midnight and spent two days brainstorming ideas for a film.

				<p>
					The plot usually starts with a simple problem that the characters must overcome. As they do so, a supernatural or magical element appears and complicates the issue. <sup>[4]</sup> The writers of the show decided on this narrative structure so they could take advantage of the animation.<sup>[4]</sup>

					The series is rated TV-PG-V.<sup>[4]</sup> Cartoon Network told the creators that they wanted to age up the TV-Y7 they normally did on the network. This comment inspired the crew to use adult humor, so the show includes a lot of innuendos and drug and alcohol references.
